We are excited and proud to announce that,
following <a href="/article/ngi-search-grant" target="_blank">NGI Search funding</a> and
several <a href="/talks" target="_blank">conference talks</a>,
Spare Cores has achieved another significant milestone:
we have been accepted into the
<a href="https://nvda.ws/2BvtUc9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Inception Program</a>,
which nurtures startups revolutionizing industries with technological advancements ðŸŽ‰

Joining NVIDIA Inception will help Spare Cores to boost and extend our benchmarking capabilities,
particularly in the realms of evaluating mathematical and statistical computations;
training and scoring classification or regression models, also forecasting methods; and other
machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as:

- Training gradient boosting models (GBM) using various implementations (e.g. xgboost or lightgbm) and data sizes,
- Finding paths between network nodes (e.g. Dijkstra's algorithm),
- Detecting and classifying objects with neural network (e.g. MobileNet v1 SSD),
- Image processing tasks (e.g. blurring image backgrounds or removing objects from photos using DeepLabV3+),
- Ray tracing (e.g. Blender),
- Measuring the inference speed of open-source LLM models (e.g. LLaMA 3) when generating and processing tokens.

The NVIDIA Inception Program will also offer us the opportunity to collaborate with
industry-leading experts and other AI-driven organizations.

NVIDIA Inception helps startups during critical stages of product development,
prototyping and deployment. Every Inception member gets a custom set of ongoing benefits,
such as NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute credits,
preferred pricing on NVIDIA hardware and software, and technological assistance,
which provides startups with the fundamental tools to help them grow.
