It's fantastic to get back to in-person events after the pandemic, and
meeting other open-source developers, and potentially future Spare
Cores users as well! Since the project just started a few months ago,
the networking opportunity at live conferences is crucial for
spreading the news on Spare Cores.

We're excited to announce that at least one team member will be
presenting at three conferences in the coming weeks:

- June 9-11: <a href="https://2024.berlinbuzzwords.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Buzzwords 2024</a> (Germany)
- June 10-12: <a href="https://budapestdata.hu/2024/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Budapest Data+ML Forum 2024</a> (Hungary)
- July 8-11: <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useR! 2024</a> (Austria)

We look forward to meeting with you! If you're around, be sure to say hello
â€” it would be fantastic to chat about utilizing cloud compute resources :)

If you might miss these events, you can find the slides presented and
often the actual video recording as well on our [Talks page](/talks).
