As mentioned in the [previous article](/article/upcoming-conferences-2024-Q4),
I've represented Spare Cores at the
<a href="https://sfscon.org/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFSCon 2024</a>
conference in Bolzano. The trip to Italy was a blast -- my first time on a night train :)

SFSCon is a conference with a focus on free software and the open source community, with a strong history of 20 years. It was a great pleasure to be part of it!

My talk was about <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/optimizing-cloud-compute-resources-with-spare-cores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimizing Cloud Compute Resources with Spare Cores</a>, and as all standard talks, it was limited to 15 minutes .. for which I prepared over 100 slides, so it was a bit of a challenge, but managed to deliver on time â€” inlcuding a few minutes for questions at the end. If you are interested in a quick intro on what are the Spare Cores components, this might be a good starting point:

This was also the first time we had a booth at a conference, and we are super grateful for <a href="https://www.ow2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OW2</a> for offering us this opportunity to present our work to the community:

It was a busy 2 days, and I met many interesting people. I must highlight how well organized the conference was, and how helpful and professionalthe organizers were. Thank you!

Now we are preparing for our upcoming trip to Paris next week (Dec 4-5, 2024) to the <a href="https://www.opensource-experience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Experience</a> conference with over 5,000 expected attendees, where we will also give a talk and run a booth along with the OW2 and NGI Search teams. If you are around, please don't be a stranger, and stop by to say hi!
