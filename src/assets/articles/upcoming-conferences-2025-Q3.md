It's a great pleasure to return to the useR! conference series again! [Last year](/article/upcoming-conferences-2024-Q3), we presented the Spare Cores Navigator project, and this time the focus is on observability, introducing:

- The <a href="https://github.com/daroczig/logger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>logger</code> R package</a> as a modern logging framework for the R community with already 300+ GitHub stars and many users,
- The R bindings of the Spare Cores [Resource Tracker](/article/metaflow-resource-tracker) to track the hardware utilization of R scripts in a non-blocking way, featuring detailed data, aggregate statistics, and fancy-looking reports.

Spare Cores is proud to sponsor the event this year, so if you are around, please stop by our booth to say hi and grab a hex sticker!

If you are rather a Pythonista, we are happy to share we will also be attending PyData both in <a href="https://pydata.org/berlin2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin</a> and <a href="https://amsterdam.pydata.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amsterdam</a> this year, presenting about:

- The Resource Tracker package,
- [How we benchmarked 2,000+ cloud servers for LLM inference speed](http://localhost:4200/article/llm-inference-speed).

We hope to see you at one of the events! If you can't make it to the events in person, you can find the slides presented and often the actual video recording as well on our [Talks page](/talks).
