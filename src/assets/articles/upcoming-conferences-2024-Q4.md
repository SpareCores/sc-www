We're excited to announce that at least one team member will be
presenting at the following conferences in the coming weeks:

- Nov 8-9: <a href="https://www.sfscon.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFSCON 2024</a> (Bolzano, Italy)
- Dec 4-5: <a href="https://www.opensource-experience.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Experience</a> (Paris, France)

A few packs of printed hex stickers just arrived, so we will have some
with us to give away:

</div>

We will be also attending <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS re:Invent 2024</a> between Dec 2-6 (Las Vegas, USA), so if you are around, be sure to say hi â€” we look forward to meeting with you!

If you might miss these events, you can find the slides presented and
often the actual video recording as well on our [Talks page](/talks).
