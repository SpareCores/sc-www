We had been planning to benchmark the prompt processing and text generation
speeds of various LLMs for some time, especially after our acceptance into the
[NVIDIA Inception Program](/article/nvidia-inception/). The final push came with
the announcement of the <a
href="https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-budapest-presents-kcd-budapest-2025/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) in Budapest</a>.
We submitted a talk proposal promising to benchmark inference speeds on over
2000 cloud servers, which was accepted! This motivated us to accelerate our
related work at last to meet the deadline.

This article offers a technical overview of some of our related design
decisions and the implementation details. But if you're here for the numbers,
some of our highlights:

- **No one-size-fits-all**: There is no single instance type that is the optimal
  choice for all LLM serving needs. Depending on the LLM size and task (e.g.
  prompt processing VS text generation), different server options deliver the
  fastest speed and highest cost-efficiency.
- **Performance vs. Cost Trade-off**: While NVIDIA GPUs generally provide
  significantly higher performance due to CUDA optimization, CPU-only servers
  can sometimes be more cost-efficient, especially when considering the
  aggregate performance of multiple cheaper instances compared to a few
  expensive GPU servers.
- **Multi-GPU Utilization Challenges**: Despite advancements in LLM serving
  frameworks, effectively utilizing multiple GPUs on a single server remains
  challenging. While beneficial for large models that require multiple GPUs to
  fit all layers into VRAM, smaller models don't scale performance significantly
  across multiple GPUs.

technical details, feel free to skip ahead to the
[Results](/article/llm-inference-speed#results).

## Infrastructure

We already had the core infrastructure in place to run containerized benchmarks
on any or all of our ~2300 supported cloud server configurations:

- **<a href="https://www.pulumi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulumi</a> templates**
  (in our `sc-runner` repo) to provision and tear down servers and the related
  storage, network environment, etc.
- **Multi-architecture Docker images** built via GitHub Actions in our `sc-images` repository.
- **Task definitions** in our `sc-inspector` Python module to orchestrate `sc-runner`.
- **Raw-result storage** in the open, copyleft-licensed `sc-inspector-data` repo.
- **ETL & publishing** via the open-source `sc-crawler` Python package into our copyleft-licensed `sc-data` repository.

With all this in place, the next steps seemed straightforward:

1. Build a new Docker image in `sc-images`.
2. Add a few lines of task definition to `sc-inspector`.
3. Configure `sc-crawler` to structure and publish the data to `sc-data`.

And that should have been it ... well, almost.

## Serving LLMs in a Heterogeneous Environment

The primary challenge was serving LLMs across a highly heterogeneous
environment, ranging from tiny machines with less than 1GB of RAM to high-end
servers featuring terabytes of memory, hundreds of CPU cores, and sometimes
multiple powerful GPUs from various manufacturers with differing drivers.

Our initial search focused on an LLM serving framework capable of running
inference on both CPUs and GPUs with minimal fine-tuning, ensuring compatibility
across all our supported cloud servers. After evaluating several candidates, we
settled on <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">Georgi Gerganov's excellent `llama.cpp`</a>. This lightweight and
high-performant inference engine for large language models, written in C and
C++, offers several key advantages:

- It supports both CPU and GPU inference.
- It benefits from a very active development community, is constantly improving,
  and is widely adopted.
- It features a robust CI/CD pipeline that builds container images for multiple
  architectures, including `x86_64` and `ARM64`, along with a CUDA-enabled build.
- It utilizes GGML, providing optimized builds for a wide range of CPU
  microarchitectures (e.g., from Intel Sandy Bridge to Sapphire Rapids).
- It includes a configurable benchmarking script (`llama-bench`) for measuring
  inference speed across repeated text generation or prompt processing runs.

While `llama.cpp` provides separate Docker images for CPU and CUDA support, our
goal was to deliver a unified container image compatible with all target
architectures.
To accomplish this, we created a new image that bundles both the CPU and CUDA
binaries, and extracts the necessary
<a href="https://github.com/SpareCores/sc-images/blob/main/images/benchmark-llm/extract-shared-cpu-libs.sh"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared libraries</a> from their respective base images.
We also added a lightweight wrapper script to
<a href="https://github.com/SpareCores/sc-images/blob/main/images/benchmark-llm/benchmark.py#L113C26-L114C1"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatically select the appropriate backend at runtime</a>.

## Large Language Models

To ensure a comprehensive benchmark, we selected a diverse set of widely used
LLMs, varying in size and capabilities:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Parameters</th>
      <th style="text-align: center;">File Size</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SmolLM-135M.Q4_K_M.gguf</td>
      <td class="param-size"><span class="num">135</span><span class="unit">M</span></td>
      <td class="file-size"><span class="num">100</span><span class="unit">MB</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>qwen1_5-0_5b-chat-q4_k_m.gguf</td>
      <td class="param-size"><span class="num">500</span><span class="unit">M</span></td>
      <td class="file-size"><span class="num">400</span><span class="unit">MB</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gemma-2b.Q4_K_M.gguf</td>
      <td class="param-size"><span class="num">2</span><span class="unit">B</span></td>
      <td class="file-size"><span class="num">1.5</span><span class="unit">GB</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>llama-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf</td>
      <td class="param-size"><span class="num">7</span><span class="unit">B</span></td>
      <td class="file-size"><span class="num">4</span><span class="unit">GB</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>phi-4-q4.gguf</td>
      <td class="param-size"><span class="num">14</span><span class="unit">B</span></td>
      <td class="file-size"><span class="num">9</span><span class="unit">GB</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf</td>
      <td class="param-size"><span class="num">70</span><span class="unit">B</span></td>
      <td class="file-size"><span class="num">42</span><span class="unit">GB</span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

We used quantized versions of each model, which significantly reduce memory
usage and load times. The models ranged in size from around 100 million to 70
billion parameters.

Starting each machine from a clean state required downloading our combined
container image (\~7 GB) and then the selected models (\~60 GB). This meant
benchmarks needed to run on machines with at least 75 GB of disk space.

Keeping costs under control was also crucial. For example, downloading the
largest model (\~42 GB) on a small machine with limited bandwidth could take
over an hour, and then eventually failing due to memory constraints.

To mitigate this, we implemented a background thread downloading the models
sequentially, prioritized by size. Once a model was downloaded, we marked it as
ready for benchmarking in the main thread. Models were then evaluated in
sequence, with early termination if inference speed fell below a predefined
threshold. If the next model in line was likely to exceed bandwidth or
performance limits, the process was halted to avoid unnecessary cost.

## Cost Control

These thresholds we applied were dynamic, depending on the task (prompt
processing or text generation) and the token length of the input or output. For
instance, a throughput of 1 token per second might be acceptable for generating
short responses, but it would be impractical for batch processing 32k-token
inputs, where a minimum of 1,000 tokens per second is more appropriate. This
adaptive strategy allowed us to optimize runtime and control costs across
diverse workloads.

By applying these constraints, we were able to keep the overall budget for
starting 2000+ servers under $10k â€” at least in theory.
We ended up with the following cost breakdown per vendor:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
  <th>
    <b>Vendor</b>
  </th>
  <th>
    <b>Cost</b>
  </th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tr><td>AWS</td><td class="cost-value"><span class="num">2153.68</span> <span class="unit">USD</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>GCP</td><td class="cost-value"><span class="num">696.9</span> <span class="unit">USD</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Azure</td><td class="cost-value"><span class="num">8036.71</span> <span class="unit">USD</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hetzner</td><td class="cost-value"><span class="num">8.65</span> <span class="unit">EUR</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Upcloud</td><td class="cost-value"><span class="num">170.21</span> <span class="unit">EUR</span></td></tr>
</table>

In practice, we spent well over $10k on this project. We experienced unexpected
costs at Azure due to instances not being terminated as expected, but
fortunately, these were covered by generous cloud credits from vendors.
We are grateful for their support!

## Coverage and Limitations

We managed to successfully run the benchmarks on 2,106 cloud servers out of the
currently tracked 2,343 servers across five vendors (as of April 30, 2025),
spanning various CPU architectures and configurations:

```sh
[sc-inspector-data]$ find . -name meta.json -path "*llm*" | \
  xargs jq -cr 'select(.exit_code == 0)' | \
  wc -l
2106
```

While we continue to evaluate the remaining \~235 server types,
full coverage is unlikely due to the following reasons:

- **Quota limits** imposed by vendors (see our <a href="/debug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debug page</a> for per-vendor details).
- **Insufficient memory** (less than 1 GiB) to load even the smallest model.
- **Limited storage** (less than 75 GiB) that cannot be easily extended (e.g., cloud server plans with fixed disk size).
- **Deprecation** of server types by the vendor.

It's also worth noting that although `llama.cpp` successfully ran on most
servers, performance was not always optimal. For example:

- **Non-NVIDIA GPUs** could not be used for inference due to lack of CUDA compatibility.
- Some **NVIDIA cards** (e.g. T4G) were also incompatible due to driver issues.

In such cases, the LLM inference speed benchmarks defaulted to CPU execution.

Finally, although `llama.cpp` can utilize multiple GPUs, this primarily benefits
larger LLMs to load all layers into VRAM. Smaller models that easily fit on a
single GPU's memory do not significantly benefit from having multiple GPUs. To
potentially improve this, we could extend the current implementation to start
multiple instances of the benchmarking script on the same machine, e.g. one for
each GPU. However, as this would involve significant heuristics and complexity,
we decided to keep the approach simple (and more reliable) for now.

## Results

Overall, we evaluated more than 2000 servers and ran prompt processing and text
generation tasks using 1-6 LLMs (depending on the available amount of memory or
VRAM) with various token lengths and input/output sizes, resulting in almost 75k
data points.

To count how many servers could successfully run each model, we queried our
<a href="https://sc-data-public-40e9d310.s3.amazonaws.com/sc-data-all.db.bz2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live database dump</a> (36 MB SQLite file):

```sql
WITH models as (
  SELECT DISTINCT vendor_id, server_id, json_extract(config, '$.model') AS model
  FROM benchmark_score
  WHERE benchmark_id LIKE 'llm_%')
SELECT model, COUNT(*)
FROM models
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

Results as of April 30, 2025:

| model                                | COUNT(*) |
|--------------------------------------|----------|
| SmolLM-135M.Q4_K_M.gguf              | 2086     |
| qwen1_5-0_5b-chat-q4_k_m.gguf        | 1962     |
| gemma-2b.Q4_K_M.gguf                 | 1883     |
| llama-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf                 | 1713     |
| phi-4-q4.gguf                        | 1448     |
| Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf   | 1229     |

Thus, depending on your LLM inference needs, the number of viable server options
might be limited â€” but still having over 1,000 cloud server types for the
largest (70B) model.

## Case Study: Phi 4

As an example, let's take a look at the results for the `phi-4-q4.gguf` model
with 14B parameters. We filtered for servers that achieved at least 50 tokens
per second in prompt processing of 512-token inputs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM benchmark_score
WHERE
  benchmark_id = 'llm_speed:prompt_processing'
  AND json_extract(config, '$.model') = 'phi-4-q4.gguf'
  AND json_extract(config, '$.tokens') = 512
  AND score >= 50
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

This returned around 600 servers, ranging from:
- **Fastest**: 4,768 tokens/sec (AWS `g6e` family with NVIDIA L40S GPUs)
- **Slowest**: Just over the provided threshold, using CPU only.

## Price-Performance Analysis

Calculating the performance for the price requires us to join the `server_price`
table, for example taking into account the best on-demand server price:

```sql
WITH scores AS (
  SELECT vendor_id, server_id, score
  FROM benchmark_score
  WHERE
    benchmark_id = 'llm_speed:prompt_processing'
    AND json_extract(config, '$.model') = 'phi-4-q4.gguf'
    AND json_extract(config, '$.tokens') = 512
    AND score >= 500),
prices AS (
  SELECT vendor_id, server_id, MIN(price) AS price
  FROM server_price
  WHERE allocation = 'ONDEMAND'
  GROUP BY 1, 2)
SELECT
  scores.vendor_id AS vendor, api_reference AS server, 
  vcpus, memory_amount / 1024 AS memory, gpu_count AS gpus, gpu_model, 
  ROUND(score, 2) AS score, price, ROUND(score / price, 2) AS score_per_price
FROM scores
LEFT JOIN prices USING (vendor_id, server_id)
LEFT JOIN server USING (vendor_id, server_id)
ORDER BY score_per_price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This returns the following top 10 servers on April 30, 2025:

| vendor | server | vcpus | memory | gpus | gpu_model | score | price | score_per_price |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gcp | g2-standard-4 | 4 | 16 | 1 | L4 | 1194.57 | 0.14631 | 8164.64 |
| gcp | g2-standard-8 | 8 | 32 | 1 | L4 | 1137.47 | 0.29262 | 3887.2 |
| gcp | a2-highgpu-1g | 12 | 85 | 1 | A100 | 2468.31 | 0.73948 | 3337.9 |
| gcp | g2-standard-12 | 12 | 48 | 1 | L4 | 1162.21 | 0.43893 | 2647.82 |
| aws | g6e.xlarge | 4 | 32 | 1 | L40S | 4660.96 | 1.861 | 2504.54 |
| gcp | a2-ultragpu-1g | 12 | 170 | 1 | A100 | 2475.82 | 1.09962 | 2251.52 |
| aws | g6e.2xlarge | 8 | 64 | 1 | L40S | 4677.89 | 2.24208 | 2086.4 |
| gcp | g2-standard-16 | 16 | 64 | 1 | L4 | 1117.46 | 0.58525 | 1909.36 |
| aws | g5.xlarge | 4 | 16 | 1 | A10G | 1887.03 | 1.006 | 1875.77 |
| gcp | a2-highgpu-2g | 24 | 170 | 2 | A100 | 2469.94 | 1.47895 | 1670.06 |

In this scenario, the smallest GPU options are the most cost efficient: with a
single GPU, minimal CPU and irrelevant memory amount as data are stored in the
VRAM anyway.

The computed `score_per_price` shows how much inference speed you can buy with
1 USD/hour. The most cost-effective option from the above table suggests that a
`g2-standard-4` costs $0.14631/hour, so we could get almost 7 servers for 1
USD/hour, providing 8164+ tokens/second overall inference speed, which
translates to \~3.4 US cents per 1M tokens when fully utilized.

The next best option (`g2-standard-8`) provides the same performance as equipped
with the same GPU, which is doing all the work independent of the extra CPU
cores or memory amount, so the cost efficiency is around the half of the first
one due to the doubled costs, with identical throughput.

## Visual Exploration

If you might prefer a more intuitive way of getting access to this data, look no
further: this is easily accessible from our <a href="/servers" target="_blank">Server Navigator</a>!
Just select the preferred LLM inference speed benchmark instead of the default
`stress-ng` on the top of the table, as e.g. in the below screenshot:

<div class="text-center m-2.5 mt-8 mb-6">

</div>
<p style="margin: 0px 50px 20px 50px; text-align: center; color: #999;">Image source: <a href="/servers?order_by=selected_benchmark_score&order_dir=desc&columns=1187464&benchmark=eyJpZCI6ImxsbV9zcGVlZDpwcm9tcHRfcHJvY2Vzc2luZyIsImNvbmZpZyI6IntcImZyYW1ld29ya192ZXJzaW9uXCI6IFwiNTFmMzExZTBcIiwgXCJtb2RlbFwiOiBcInBoaS00LXE0LmdndWZcIiwgXCJ0b2tlbnNcIjogNTEyfSJ9" target="_blank">Spare Cores server listing</a>.</p>

Clicking on a row will take you to the server details page, including all the
LLM inference speed results that are also embedded below for the above-mentioned
`g2-standard-4` server as interactive charts:

 style="height: 510px; width: 100%; border: 1px solid #34d399; border-radius: 8px; min-height: 400px; margin-top: 20px;">
</iframe>

You might wonder now if it is the best server for all LLM needs? As usual, it
depends.

## Model Size Impacts

If you need to serve smaller models fitting in the VRAM of a
`g2-standard-4`, it is an excellent choice, but if you serve larger models, you
might need more powerful GPU options, or go with the much cheaper CPU-only
servers. Another similar example using the 70B model for text generation:

<div class="text-center m-2.5 mt-8 mb-6">
  <img class="zoomin w-full"
    alt="Cloud server listing ordered by the performance of text generation using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf. "
    src="/assets/images/blog/llm-listing2.webp"/>
</div>
<p style="margin: 0px 50px 20px 50px; text-align: center; color: #999;">
  Image source:
  <a href="/servers?order_by=selected_benchmark_score_per_price&order_dir=desc&columns=1187464&benchmark=eyJpZCI6ImxsbV9zcGVlZDp0ZXh0X2dlbmVyYXRpb24iLCJjb25maWciOiJ7XCJmcmFtZXdvcmtfdmVyc2lvblwiOiBcIjUxZjMxMWUwXCIsIFwibW9kZWxcIjogXCJMbGFtYS0zLjMtNzBCLUluc3RydWN0LVE0X0tfTS5nZ3VmXCIsIFwidG9rZW5zXCI6IDEyOH0ifQ==" target="_blank">Spare Cores server listing</a>.
</p>

In this case, GPUs with more memory are required to load all layers into VRAM,
so the most cost-efficient options are the cheapest instances with an A100 GPU.

Although the CPU-only options are much less performant (a single A100 delivers
20+ tokens/second, while 32 vCPUs provide overall 3-4 tokens/second), there are
many much cheaper servers available providing a good cost efficiency as well â€”
as you can see in the above table.

Looking at the smallest LLM model:

<div class="text-center m-2.5 mt-8 mb-6">
  <img class="zoomin w-full"
    alt="Cloud server listing ordered by the performance of text generation using SmolLM-135M.Q4_K_M.gguf. "
    src="/assets/images/blog/llm-listing3.webp"/>
</div>
<p style="margin: 0px 50px 20px 50px; text-align: center; color: #999;">
  Image source:
  <a href="/servers?order_by=selected_benchmark_score_per_price&order_dir=desc&columns=1187464&benchmark=eyJpZCI6ImxsbV9zcGVlZDp0ZXh0X2dlbmVyYXRpb24iLCJjb25maWciOiJ7XCJmcmFtZXdvcmtfdmVyc2lvblwiOiBcIjUxZjMxMWUwXCIsIFwibW9kZWxcIjogXCJTbW9sTE0tMTM1TS5RNF9LX00uZ2d1ZlwiLCBcInRva2Vuc1wiOiA1MTJ9In0=" target="_blank">Spare Cores server listing</a>.
</p>

In this case, it's clear that the winners are the cheapest tiny servers.
