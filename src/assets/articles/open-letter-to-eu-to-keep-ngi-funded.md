Since 2020, <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
Next Generation Internet (NGI)</a> programs,
part of European Commission's Horizon program,
fund free software in Europe using a cascade funding mechanism (see
for example <a href="https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NLnet's calls</a>).
This year, according to the Horizon Europe working draft detailing funding programs for 2025,
we notice that Next Generation Internet is not mentioned any more as part of Cluster 4.

NGI programs have shown their strength and importance to support the
European software infrastructure, as a generic funding instrument to
fund digital commons and ensure their long-term sustainability.
For more details, see the
<a href="https://www.ngi.eu/news/2024/07/11/ngi-impact-study/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI Impact Report</a>.

We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has
proven efficient and ecomomical to support free software as a whole,
from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem
diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and
maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to
software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to
enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to
common perception, technical innovations often originate from Europe,
and mostly initiated by small-scaled organizations.

Previous Cluster 4 allocated 27 millions euros to:

- Human centric Internet aligned with values and principles commonly
  shared in Europe;
- A flourishing internet, based on common building blocks created
  within NGI, that enables better control of our digital life;
- A structured eco-system of talented contributors driving the
  creation of new internet commons and the evolution of existing
  internet commons.

In the name of these challenges, more than 500 projects received NGI
funding in the first 5 years (for example us, Spare Cores as well via
the <a href="/article/ngi-search-grant">NGI Search initiative</a>),
backed by 18 organisations managing these European funding consortia.

NGI contributes to a vast ecosystem, as most of its budget is
allocated to fund third parties by the means of open calls, to
structure commons that cover the whole Internet scope - from hardware
to application, operating systems, digital identities or data traffic
supervision. This third-party funding is not renewed in the current
program, leaving many projects short on resources for research and
innovation in Europe.

Moreover, NGI allows exchanges and collaborations across all the Euro
zone countries as well as "widening countries"¹, currently both a
success and and an ongoing progress, likewise the Erasmus programme
before us. NGI also contributes to opening and supporting longer
relationships than strict project funding does. It encourages to
implement projects funded as pilots, backing collaboration,
identification and reuse of common elements across projects,
interoperability in identification systems and beyond, and setting up
development models that mix diverse scales and types of European
funding schemes.

NGI supports free and open source software since 2020, which lets us
keep our data local and favors a community-wide economy and know-how,
while allowing an international collaboration.
