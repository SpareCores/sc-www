As most of our open-source components have reached the beta,
with some even achieving production/stable status (as typically defined in
<a href="https://martin-thoma.com/software-development-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software development</a>),
they are now deemed "feature complete". We have started
usability testing of our homepage and
are eagerly seeking feedback on our other component as well.
This is why we have begun attending and [presenting at conferences](/article/upcoming-conferences-2024-Q3)
over the past few weeks.

Now, we are taking a more quantitative approach by surveying DevOps,
CloudOps, platform engineering, and other tech teams to learn about
their cloud use cases for containerized batch jobs and microservices.

The survey should take no more than 5 minutes to complete. All
questions are optional, and some are automatically skipped based on
your previous answers. You can keep your reposes totally anonymous.
By participating, you will help us immensely by providing valuable insights.
Optionally, you can also choose to be notified about the results, either
directly via email or indirectly through our blog or social media posts.

In short, please fill in our "[Cloud Use Cases Questionnaire](/survey/cloud-use-cases-2024)"!
