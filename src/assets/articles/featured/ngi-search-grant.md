Attila and Gergely have been ideating on the idea of a SaaS solution
to inventory cloud compute resources, tooling for selecting the
optimal instance type and settings for batch jobs, with additional
services to monitor and auto-scale jobs etc for years; but due to other
full-time commitments and lack of resources, we did not have a chance
to take it seriously.

This changed in 2023, when we learned about the <a
href="https://www.ngisearch.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI
Search project</a> with the promise of funding open-source projects
for a full year, with enough budget for part-time/full-time dedicated
dev work, legal and design tasks, and experimenting with the tech
stack at various cloud providers. So we decided to submit a proposal
for the 3rd Open Call in Q3.

The application process was a breeze â€“ hats off to the NGI Search
team!  It was also useful for us to review and clearly articulate what
we are actually going to build.

We were super excited about this opportunity, and started planning right
away, with the hope of being selected and getting funded in 2024.

Time passed quickly, and in November 2023, we got the great news:
Spare Cores was selected as part of the 10-team cohort out of the 94
applicants! Find more details at the <a

Search projects (from overall 5 open calls).

We finalized the required paperwork, and knowing that the project is
actually happening, we started to prepare with more detailed designs
for the Spare Cores ecosystem. Stay tuned to learn more in the coming
months!
