A couple of days ago, Spare Cores had the incredible honor of being featured on <a href="https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pragmatic Engineer</a>, one of the most influential blogs in the software engineering world. This blog, founded by Gergely Orosz, is a go-to resource for hundreds of thousands of engineers, leaders, and decision-makers. The accompanying newsletter, *The Pulse*, reaches a staggering 750k subscribers. For a young project with a small team like ours, this was a game-changer for visibility and engagement. ðŸš€

## How it happened?

It might surprise you to learn that this all started with a cold email. I reached out to Gergely Orosz using the email address shared on his blog for the purpose of suggesting topics for The Pulse newsletter, and I shamelessly recommended that Spare Cores might resonate with his audience, along with a short blob on what we do.

To my delight, Gergely found our project interesting enough to cover! After a couple of email exchanges and a few weeks later, our story went live.

## What happened afterwards?

The response was overwhelming! Here's a glimpse of the incredible engagement we received on social media:

- **LinkedIn:** Close to **1,000 actions** including likes, comments, reshares, connection requests, and direct messages.
- **Twitter/X:** Over **2,600 likes** and dozens of replies and great questions.

Furthermore, we received numerous direct emails:

- **Community feedback:** Engineers and industry professionals reached out with feedback and ideas for improvement (e.g. fixing bugs). Many of these conversations led to live calls and ongoing discussions.
- **Vendor inquiries:** Several cloud server providers expressed interest in being integrated in the Spare Cores ecosystem, offering credits and technical support to make this happen.
- **Partnership opportunities:** We were excited to get intros to FinOps and cloud advisory firms, and we're looking forward to some great collaborations.
- **Investment interest:** Early-stage investors also reached out, and we're excited to see where these conversations lead.

## Thank you!

We owe a huge thanks to Gergely Orosz and *The Pragmatic Engineer* for this opportunity. Itâ€™s incredible to see the impact of being featured on a platform that engineers truly trust.  

And thank you to everyone who engaged with us, asked questions, provided feedback, or opened a few doors for us!
