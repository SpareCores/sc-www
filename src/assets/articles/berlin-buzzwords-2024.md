We have debuted the Spare Cores project at a major in-person
conference for the first time! It was also my first time at
<a href="https://2024.berlinbuzzwords.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Buzzwords</a>
— a fantastic conference on streaming and searching large amounts of data.

First of all, hats off to the organizers of Berlin Buzzwords: it was a
super smooth and fun experience to submit a talk idea, discuss the
details, get to the venue, present, and enjoy the rest of the event!
We couldn't have dreamed of a better place to present Spare Cores to
the public in person for the first time.

We got the first time slot on Tuesday in the Frannz Salon, so I made
sure to visit talks in the same room on Monday to get more familiar
with the venue. I'd highlight
<a href="https://program.berlinbuzzwords.de/bbuzz24/talk/HMQMDH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
Nicolas Fränkel's OpenTelemetry talk</a>
with hands-on examples and demos — a very good introduction
to the topic and the selected implementation as well.

After lunch, I explored the other rooms as well, and planned to attend
<a href="https://program.berlinbuzzwords.de/bbuzz24/talk/EDT99N/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
William Benton's rather philosophical talk on LLMs are (not) a paradigm shift</a>
since I had the pleasure
to walk with him to the speaker dinner the previous day, and he was
such a great company — and turned out to be a fantastic speaker as well,
with interesting ideas to share.

Since I run Home Assistant with a bunch of IoT devices at home,
I also listened into
<a href="https://program.berlinbuzzwords.de/bbuzz24/talk/BQTZHK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
Nick Burch's "Monitoring your home" talk</a>,
and was excited to watch
<a href="https://program.berlinbuzzwords.de/bbuzz24/talk/BVGPGZ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
Olivier Huber's "Build your 8-bit computer from scratch" presentation</a> later.

What a day! And I still had to polish my slides for the next morning :)

So, how did it go? Please judge for yourself! You can find the slides
on our [Talks page](/talks), and the video recording at my
