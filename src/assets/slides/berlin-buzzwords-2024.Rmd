I've been working as a DS/Dir of Analytics/Sr Dir of Data Ops in the past decade,
responsible for the DS infrastructure to run various algorithm, e.g.

- SQL: lightweight on the client side
- scripts: can be lightweight as well (e.g. API integrations or simple models),

BUT might require a lot of compute resource depending on the type of the model

To give you an example: here's a job that we monitored every few seconds and saw that it doesn't really scale to multiple CPUs, but taking up to ~200 gigs of memory -- probably training a hierarchical model that cannot be paralellized.

so we had around 4k/day ...

so we had around 4k jobs/day with varying needs

- Training hierarchical models on a large dataset using R required several hundreds GBs of RAM,
- NLP models in Python required GPUs,
- Parallelized time-series forecasting models required many CPUs,
- Many small jobs mostly waiting for SQL results running on a shared host.
- or submitting new bid amounts on ads on a social network

to solve for that, at some point we used Amazon ECS ...
super excited when AWS Batch was announces with the promise of managing the clusters for us

... similarly how other teams got excited about Kubernetes

AWS Batch seemed like a good fit and relatively convenient solution,
but after a few months trial, we experienced unexpected costs
due to developers misconfiguring resource requirements

- overprovisioning to avoid errors
- forgot to update etc

and bin packing ...

<div class="notes">
AWS bin packing smaller jobs to already running larger nodes (started for heavy jobs), which resulted in keeping the expensive nodes running for a longer time.

so instead, we decided to roll our own solution after all .. building on the fact that the price of the cloud resources is not discounted by its size .. so running two containers on a larger node VS running on separate nodes make no difference from a pricing perspective

- stats/ML/AI model training,
- ETL pipelines,
- traditional CI/CD workflows for compiling and testing software,

<div class="notes">
so it's like AWS Fargate or Google Cloud Run ... but with auto-scaling and much much cheaper, especially while AWS supported spot instances with blocked duration (until a couple of months ago)

as it seemed useful for many use-cases, we decided and were supported to open-source most of the infra tooling ...

was released as "cloudperf" a couple years ago, and the team has been maintaining it since then

BUT, it was limited to a single vendor, we also had some new ideas, so it was time to build the next generation ... called Spare Cores, which started thanks to the generous support of the NGI Search project.

  <h2>&#62;&#62;&#62; from sparecores import intro</h2>

* Open-source tools, database schemas and documentation to inspect and inventory cloud vendors and their compute resource offerings.

. . .

* Managed infrastructure, databases, APIs, SDKs, and web applications to make these data sources publicly accessible.

. . .

* Helpers to start and manage instances in your own environment.

. . .

* SaaS to run containers in a managed environment without direct vendor engagement.

<aside class="notes">
- so Spare Cores is an open-source ecosystem, including software, database schemas, guides,
- and actual databases if you don't want to run the ETL tooling yourself .. also providing APIs, SDKs etc to make it easier to query data
- unified CLI to start machines
- and working on an an optional SaaS offering built on the top of the open-source tooling for folks who would rather avoid registering with all cloud providers etc: give us a Docker image, a command to run, and you credit card .. all set, we will run it wherever it's cheapest.

We help DevOps, DS, ML, AI, ETL, AV, and other engineering teams to find optimal instances for their batch jobs (e.g. “8 CPU cores, 64 GB of RAM, and a TPU needed in an EU datacenter to train ML models for 6 hours”) by providing:

* Open-source tools, database schemas and documentation to monitor cloud and flexible VPS/dedicated server vendors and their compute resource offerings in an innovative and truly comparative way, including vendor details (e.g. location, certificates, green power), compute capabilities (e.g. CPU, memory, GPU/TPU), pricing (especially of spot instances), and performance (by running task-specific benchmarks).
* Managed infrastructure, databases, APIs, SDKs, and web applications to make these continuously and transparently tracked data sources publicly available and comparable in a validated, unbiased, structured, and searchable manner.
* Helpers to easily start and manage instances at all the supported vendors with a standardized API.
* SaaS

BUT let's focus on the open-source and open-data components ..

and we also run benchmark scenarios on the servers, e.g.:

- memory bandwidth of read, write and mixed operations using various block sizes and also including the related L1/L2/L3 cache amounts
- or benchmarking compression algos - having the compression ratio on the x axis, and the bandwidth on the y axis, it's clear that `zpaq` is a beast when it comes to compressing text, but might be slow on this machine

- ETL framework with database schema and inventory method definitions

- Database migration tool supporting multiple database engines

. . .

- Manual list of vendors and metadata

. . .

- Vendor API integrations to list regions, zones, servers, storages, prices, included free traffic and IPv4 addresses etc.

. . .

- Spare Cores Inspector integration for hardware discovery and benchmark scores

. . .

- Dependency for other Spare Cores components (schemas)

<aside class="notes">
Let me start with the Crawler, our data ingest framework, which defines database schemas, and knows how to interact with the cloud provider APIs.

,,,

vendor metadata: foundation year, or compliance frameworks implemented

how to get prices info at a vendor, e.g. for IPv4 addresses which became more and more important in the recent months

,,,,

sounds relatively straightforward .. but we had a few interesting experiences :) that I wanted to share

for example, looking at the server price table definition, you can see that there are 5 primary keys our of which 4 are foreign keys as well: pointing to vendor, region, zone, and server. well, all these foreign keys have a vendor as well, so to set up the relationships between the tables properly, you have to use overlapping compound foreign keys ... which is not the most intuitive thing when it comes to ORMs

<aside class="notes">
Another complexity was due supporting multiple database engines, e.g. publishing most recent data in SQLite and collecting SCD data in Postges and CockrochDB, and maintaining the database migration tool with support for all of these. In this example we just changed a single column from `NOT NULL` to nullable, as it turned out that even the number of cores of a server might be unknown at some vendors.

offline mode support -> table def for both the SCD and non-SCD tables, same for PKs
supporting upgrade and downgrade path

but once that's done ..

So that storage data is sometimes missing from the API response .. at least in a structured way.
And we need to parse the availability of an attached local SSD from the server description.

Sometimes it's not even there .. need to extract CPU info from the vendor homepage.

And sometimes data is not even there ... we had to look that up and provide manual mappings, later automated scripts to collect that data right from the nodes.

But looking at simpler things, e.g. region definitions. Straightforward, right?

## >>> from sc_crawler import pricing

- No way to find SKUs by filtering in the API call. Get all, search locally.

. . .

- `f1-micro` is one out of 2 instances with simple pricing.

    - For other instances, lookup SKUs for CPU + RAM and do the math.

. . .

- Match instance family with SKU via search in description, e.g. `C2D`.

. . .

- Except for `c2`, which is  called “Compute optimized”.

. . .

- And `m2` is actually priced at a premium on the top of `m1`.

. . .

- The `n1` resource group is not CPU/RAM, but `N1Standard`, extract if it’s CPU or RAM price from description.

<aside class="notes">
Anyone from Google here today?

- Great, because I have some examples to share.
- Okay, I'll politely avoid naming which vendor might have one of the most interestingly implemented pricing schema ...

2 x 2 numbers .. don't ask ChatGPT to do that for you!!!

,,,

m2 pricing: look up m1 cpu/ram pricing + add the premium skus and do the math (2 times 2 numbers added and multiplied – involving 5 api lookups)

Don’t bother with zones reported that are not existing (us-west8 on May 22 .. edge network?)

it's a mess ...

okay, enough horror stories. beleive me ... it's good to have a standardize database schema and data
