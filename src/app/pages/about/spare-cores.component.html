      <h1 class="font-semibold text-3xl mb-4">Welcome to Spare Cores!</h1>
      <p>
        At Spare Cores, we believe cloud infrastructure shouldn't feel like a
        guessing game—especially for data science and machine learning teams.
        Our mission is simple: help you run every ML workflow faster, cheaper,
        and with less hassle, by turning real usage data into smart, actionable
        decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're building tools that give teams clarity, control, and
        cost-efficiency—without the overhead of traditional DevOps. And we're
        doing it the way we wish every infrastructure tool worked: transparent,
        developer-first, and workflow-native.
      </p>
      <h2>Why we started</h2>
      <p>
        Our founder,
        <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daroczig/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >Gergely Daróczi</a
        >, spent more than a decade managing infrastructure for data science
        teams. In that time, he saw the same problems again and again: engineers
        over-provisioning cloud instances "just to be safe", expensive GPUs
        sitting idle, and workloads delayed by ticket queues and
        trial-and-error. The costs added up quickly—but even more painful was
        the time lost to debugging cloud infrastructure configs instead of
        building models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spare Cores started with a simple idea: what if teams could make smart
        cloud decisions automatically, based on what their jobs actually use—not
        what they guess they'll need?
      </p>
      <p>
        We began by building a public benchmark engine, measuring thousands of
        cloud instance types across AWS, GCP, Azure, and Hetzner. That data
        became the foundation for
        <a href="/about/navigator">Spare Cores Navigator</a>, our open platform
        for exploring real-world price and performance. From there, we launched
        the open-source
        <a href="/about/resource-tracker">Resource Tracker</a> package—a
        lightweight Python/R integration for Metaflow (with Flyte, Airflow, and
        other orchestration tools coming soon), that captures real CPU, RAM, and
        GPU usage, and recommends better-fitting instances for next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, over 5,000 Metaflow steps per week are tracked with Spare Cores.
        And we're just getting started.
      </p>
      <h2>What we offer</h2>
      <p>
        Spare Cores is building a full suite of tools and services to help DS/ML
        teams cut costs and speed up experimentation—without changing how they
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our open-source packages plug directly into your workflows, collecting
        fine-grained usage data and showing exactly where you’re wasting
        compute. For teams who want more control and visibility, we offer a
        cloud-based platform called Sentinel, with two flavors:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-6">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <b>Sentinel Access</b> is our free tier. It gives individual users a
          dashboard to track their runs, see seven days of history, and get
          real-time alerts about over-provisioned jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sentinel Pro</b> is built for teams. It adds team-wide dashboards,
          historical reports, cost savings deltas, policy-based automation, and
          cross-cloud optimization—plus support for SSO and RBAC when you need
          governance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Alongside these, we also offer scalable Shiny and Streamlit hosting (on
        your cloud or ours), cloud optimization consulting, and sizing services
        for ad-hoc AI workloads like LLM labeling or document processing.
      </p>
      <h2>How we're different</h2>
      <p>
        There's no shortage of tools that show you where your cloud spend is
        going. But most of them stop at visibility—and none of them speak the
        language of ML workflows. Spare Cores lives inside your workflow. No
        portals to log into. No magic boxes. Just one line of code and
        actionable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're open by design—our benchmark engine is licensed under the Mozilla
        Public License (MPL 2.0), the related datasets under Creative Commons
        Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA), and we're committed to transparency,
        verifiability, and community trust. Our tools don't lock you in. They
        help you make smarter decisions, faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        And unlike traditional FinOps tools built for 24/7 SaaS traffic, we're
        laser-focused on batch-based experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to be your trusted sidekick—technical, transparent, and always on
        your side when it comes to cloud costs.
      </p>
      <h2>Who we are</h2>
