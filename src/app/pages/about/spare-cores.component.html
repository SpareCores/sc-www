                Welcome to Spare Cores!
            </h1>
            <p>
                At Spare Cores, we believe cloud infrastructure shouldn't feel
                like a guessing game—especially for data science and machine
                learning teams. Our mission is simple: help you run every ML
                workflow faster, cheaper, and with less hassle, by turning real
                usage data into smart, actionable decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're building tools that give teams clarity, control, and
                cost-efficiency—without the overhead of traditional DevOps. And
                we're doing it the way we wish every infrastructure tool worked:
                transparent, developer-first, and workflow-native.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Why we started
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daroczig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gergely Daróczi</a>,
                spent more than a decade managing infrastructure for data
                science teams. In that time, he saw the same problems again and
                again: engineers over-provisioning cloud instances "just to be
                safe", expensive GPUs sitting idle, and workloads delayed by
                ticket queues and trial-and-error. The costs added up
                quickly—but even more painful was the time lost to debugging
                cloud infrastructure configs instead of building models.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spare Cores started with a simple idea: what if teams could make
                smart cloud decisions automatically, based on what their jobs
                actually use—not what they guess they'll need?
            </p>
            <p>
                We began by building a public benchmark engine, measuring thousands
                of cloud instance types across AWS, GCP, Azure, and Hetzner. That
                data became the foundation for <a href="/about/navigator">Spare Cores Navigator</a>, our open
                platform for exploring real-world price and performance. From
                there, we launched the open-source <a href="/about/resource-tracker">Resource Tracker</a> package—a
                lightweight Python/R integration for Metaflow (with Flyte,
                Airflow, and other orchestration tools coming soon), that captures
                real CPU, RAM, and GPU usage, and recommends better-fitting
                instances for next time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, over 5,000 Metaflow steps per week are tracked with
                Spare Cores. And we're just getting started.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What we offer
            </h2>
            <p>
                Spare Cores is building a full suite of tools and services to
                help DS/ML teams cut costs and speed up experimentation—without
                changing how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our open-source packages plug directly into your workflows,
                collecting fine-grained usage data and showing exactly where
                you’re wasting compute. For teams who want more control and
                visibility, we offer a cloud-based platform called Sentinel,
                with two flavors:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <b>Sentinel Access</b> is our free tier. It gives individual users
                    a dashboard to track their runs, see seven days of history,
                    and get real-time alerts about over-provisioned jobs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sentinel Pro</b> is built for teams. It adds team-wide
                    dashboards, historical reports, cost savings deltas,
                    policy-based automation, and cross-cloud optimization—plus
                    support for SSO and RBAC when you need governance.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Alongside these, we also offer scalable Shiny and Streamlit
                hosting (on your cloud or ours), cloud optimization consulting,
                and sizing services for ad-hoc AI workloads like LLM labeling or
                document processing.
            </p>
            <h2>
                How we're different
            </h2>
            <p>
                There's no shortage of tools that show you where your cloud
                spend is going. But most of them stop at visibility—and none of
                them speak the language of ML workflows. Spare Cores lives
                inside your workflow. No portals to log into. No magic boxes.
                Just one line of code and actionable results.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're open by design—our benchmark engine is licensed under the
                Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0), the related datasets under
                Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA), and we're
                committed to transparency, verifiability, and community trust.
                Our tools don't lock you in. They help you make smarter
                decisions, faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                And unlike traditional FinOps tools built for 24/7 SaaS traffic,
                we're laser-focused on batch-based experimentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to be your trusted sidekick—technical, transparent, and
                always on your side when it comes to cloud costs.
            </p>
